**** Vault City ****

An attempt at doing an original game for gzdoom with the excuse of its 20th
anniversary.

The game will be a mission based action-RPG placed in the nominal Vault City,
a large cyberpunk-ish megalopolis containing vaults full of powerful Artifacts.

Every character has a different story, with a couple common missions for most of
them.
