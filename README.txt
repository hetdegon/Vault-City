# Vault City #


An attempt at doing an original game for gzdoom with the excuse of its 20th
anniversary.

The game will be a mission based action-RPG placed in the nominal Vault City,
a large cyberpunk-ish megalopolis containing vaults full of powerful Artifacts..

Every character has a different story, with a couple common missions for most of
them.

## Main characters ##

**Hacker** (*Scott Kisaragi*): A hacker finds himself in the targets of the Yakuza, and makes his escape into Vault City...
*Basic arsenal, pistols, shotguns... has control over a satellite minion and can inflict status effects on certain targets.
Gains access to a power armor later on.*

**Vampire** (*Anna Westenra*): Turned into a vampire against her will, she takes revenge into her own hands...
*Strong with heavy firearms and melee. High stats but harder to sustain.
Gains fire magic abilities and familiars later on, as well as a powered mode, "Blood Trigger".*

## Secondary characters ##
**Hitman** (*Dmitry Ivanov Kovalenko*): What would happen if your assassination target wasn't quite dead...?
*Military-class arsenal, sniper rifle and strong melee. Slow and harder to heal than normal due to cyborg parts.
Gets a giant robot.*

**Magician** (*Murakumo Shinya*): A smooth spellcaster finds himself cleaning Vault City of evil before something comes from beyond...
*More technical to play with using a wide range of attack and defense spells. Requires lots of energy and more timing.*

## Extra characters ##
**Sec-Guard** (*Ashley White*): A security guard in a local lab will find herself trapped alone against a rogue mechanoid...
*You only have access to a basic pistol, and survival is tough due to the intricacies of the location.
Finding a way to fight back is the main target of this scenario.*

**Schoolboy** (*Roger Anderson*): Can you win against the strongest of all bullies?
*A more adventurey scenario where you have to recruit other kids which determine your loadout in the crazy final battle.*

**Trickster** (*0A0A-DT-MAGPIE "Magpie A"*): A sentient dimensional weapon finds itself outmatched, during the worst crisis of the entire multiverse...
*Overpowered character fighting overpowered enemies. Extremely potent weaponry and abilities, but requires too much energy.
Can transform into its real form for more power but even higher energy costs.*
