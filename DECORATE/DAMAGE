//OK listen up this is slightly complicated.
//All damages are defined depending if they are used by enemies, by allies and by the player.
//Impact damage is meant to be "non-elemental" damage, or melee damage. Always have all attacks do some impact damage, to ensure some damage always passes
//onto enemies that are fully immune to elemental energy. This is a possibility, and will make combat potentially unwinnable, so never do it.
//The reasoning is that if you hurl a fireball to a fire elemental, the fire won't do damage, but the impact of the fireball will.
//This is so companions can use elemental attacks without harming the player. Companions also can't harm NPCs, so they don't cause damage you don't want.
//Enemies harm players and helpers and npcs. Player is immune to its own damage.
//The prefix for every damage type is:
//Pl_<element>: Player elements/effects
//Al_<element>: Ally elements/effects
//En_<element>: Enemy elements/effects
